    "what is dscr": "DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) is a measure used by lenders to determine if a property generates enough income to cover its mortgage payments. For investment properties, lenders typically require a DSCR of 1.25 or higher, meaning the property generates 25% more income than the debt payments.",
    "dscr calculation": "DSCR is calculated by dividing the annual net operating income (NOI) by the annual debt service. Formula: DSCR = NOI รท Annual Debt Service. A DSCR of 1.0 means the property's income exactly covers the debt payments.",
    "kiavi requirements": "Kiavi typically requires a minimum DSCR of 1.25, a minimum credit score of 660, and focuses on the property's income potential rather than the borrower's personal income. They also have specific requirements for property types and condition.",
    "document checklist": "The essential documents for a DSCR loan include: government ID, property details, purchase contract (if applicable), insurance information, entity documents (if using an LLC), and information about existing rental income or projected rental income.",
    "timeline": "The typical timeline for a DSCR loan is 2-3 weeks from application to closing, though this can vary based on property complexity and how quickly documents are provided.",
    "rates": "DSCR loan rates are typically 1-2% higher than conventional mortgage rates due to the higher risk profile of investment properties. Rates vary based on DSCR ratio, credit score, loan-to-value ratio, and property type."
