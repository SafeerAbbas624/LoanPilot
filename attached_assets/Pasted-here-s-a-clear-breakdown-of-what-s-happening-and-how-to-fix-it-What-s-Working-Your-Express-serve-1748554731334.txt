here's a clear breakdown of what's happening and how to fix it:

‚úÖ What's Working
Your Express server is running on port 5000

User login/auth works (/api/auth/login 200)

App routes like /loans, /messages, and /tasks are loading correctly

Google Drive fallback simulation is running, so your interface isn‚Äôt breaking

‚ùå What's Still Breaking
This error:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Could not access Google Drive with service account: 
SyntaxError: Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 2
means the app tried to JSON.parse() something that is not valid JSON.

üõ† What This Likely Means
You probably copied your Google service account credentials (from the .json file Google gave you) but pasted it into a .env or config variable as a string, not actual JSON.

For example, you might have:

env
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": ...
}
But .env files and process.env.VAR treat values as strings, and JSON.parse() then fails if you didn‚Äôt escape or format it properly.

‚úÖ How to Fix It
Option A: Save the JSON file in your Replit project

Rename the downloaded .json file (from Google) to something like serviceAccountKey.json

Upload it to your Replit project directory (in the server/ or lib/ folder)

In google.ts, import it directly like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { google } from 'googleapis';
import key from './serviceAccountKey.json' assert { type: 'json' };

const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
  credentials: key,
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'],
});
Make sure your tsconfig.json supports resolveJsonModule: true.

Option B: If you're using an ENV variable (not recommended for full JSON)

Then you'd need to escape the entire JSON:

env
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="{\"type\":\"service_account\",\"project_id\":\"...\"}"
And in code:

ts
Copy
Edit
const key = JSON.parse(process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT || '{}');
But this is error-prone and hard to maintain. Option A is cleaner and more reliable.

Next Steps
Double-check how your service account credentials are being loaded

Use the import key from './serviceAccountKey.json' method if possible

Remove or fix the .env-based JSON if you were using that approach

Let me know which option you're using and I can guide further.
