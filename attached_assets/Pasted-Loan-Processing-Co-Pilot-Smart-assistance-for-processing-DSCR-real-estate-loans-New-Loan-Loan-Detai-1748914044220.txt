WHAT IS MISSING HERE?

12:36 PM
To determine what is missing in the loan file for Galit Mazor, we need to identify the specific lender requirements from Kiavi. Unfortunately, the lender's specific document requirements are not listed. However, typically for a DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loan, the following documents might be required:

1. **Property Appraisal** - You have "Appraisal - 4533 SW 51 Street.pdf".
2. **Lease Agreements** - You have "D'ANGELO LEASE 2024 (1).pdf" and "GRIMSTEAD LEASE 2024 (1).pdf".
3. **Insurance Documents** - You have several insurance-related documents.
4. **Trust Documents** - You have "galit certificate of trust (1).pdf" and "Galit Mazor Revocable Trust.pdf".
5. **Payoff Letter** - You have "Payoff Letter -4533 SW 51st St.^J Dania Beach^J Fl 33314 (2).pdf".
6. **Voided Check** - You have "VOIDED CHECK (4).pdf".
7. **Operating Agreement** - You have "EW LESA LLC OPERATING AGREEMENT (1).pdf".
8. **EIN Number** - You have "EW LESA LLC EIN NUMBER.pdf".

Steps to identify missing documents:

1. **Confirm Lender Requirements**: Contact Kiavi to confirm the required documents for a DSCR cash-out refinance loan.
2. **Cross-Check Documents**: Compare the confirmed list with the collected documents.
3. **Identify Missing Documents**: Note any missing documents based on the confirmed lender requirements.

If you have specific lender requirements or additional tasks, please provide them, and I can assist further.
