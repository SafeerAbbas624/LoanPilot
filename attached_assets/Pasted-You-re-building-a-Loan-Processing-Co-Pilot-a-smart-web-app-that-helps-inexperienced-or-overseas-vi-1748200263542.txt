You're building a Loan Processing Co-Pilot — a smart web app that helps inexperienced or overseas virtual assistants (VAs) process DSCR real estate loans like an expert.

Here’s a clear, high-level explanation of what you’re trying to accomplish:

🧠 What You're Building
You’re creating a loan processing assistant web app that:

Helps junior processors know what to do for each DSCR loan file

Automatically checks which documents are uploaded and what’s still missing

Provides step-by-step instructions and next actions

Writes email drafts to send to borrowers, title companies, insurance agents, and lenders

Works across multiple lenders (Kiavi, Roc Capital, AHL) — each with different document checklists

Uses Google Drive to read loan file folders

Uses ChatGPT (via the OpenAI API) to generate instructions, checklists, and emails dynamically

💼 Your Use Case
You run a private lending brokerage (Adler Capital) that submits DSCR and investor loan files to several lenders. Instead of hiring expensive U.S.-based processors, you want to:

Hire low-cost, overseas VAs (like in the Philippines)

Give them a tool that shows them exactly what to do — like a virtual senior processor

Make the tool smart enough to answer their questions, flag missing docs, and help them move loans forward fast

🎯 Your Goals
Standardize your loan file processing — no matter who’s doing it

Cut down errors and back-and-forth with VAs

Scale your business without relying on hard-to-find (or expensive) experts

Make onboarding new processors nearly instant

🧱 Core Features You're Including
Google Drive integration – so the tool can read a loan folder and detect what docs are present

Lender-specific logic – like “what Kiavi needs for a DSCR purchase loan”

OpenAI GPT integration – to generate task lists, doc checklists, and email drafts

Simple UI – so VAs can chat with the tool and get clear answers, actions, and guidance

Secure login (OAuth) – to keep access private and safe

🛠️ Why You're Doing This
Because the work is repeatable — but training and trust are hard to scale. By embedding expert knowledge into a tool, you make it easier to:

Hire less experienced people

Maintain quality

Move files faster

Stay organized without constant oversight
