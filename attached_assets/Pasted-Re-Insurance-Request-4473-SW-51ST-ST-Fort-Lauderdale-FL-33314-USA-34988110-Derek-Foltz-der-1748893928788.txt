Now the only missing item is forFlood insurance when it's ready.



 1.   Insurance Agent to please update mortgagee clause on Evidence of Insurance

    to read - SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING ISAOA ATIMA PO BOX 7050 TROY, MI

    48007-7050 (currently missing ISAOA ATIMA)



Given that it's already paid, instead of waiting for the formal documentation

for flood you can share an application with the mortgage clause above, and

confirm that it has been paid in full for my team's approval.







This should work for my team to approve.

Thanks Britt, Please make the following revisions to HOI while we wait on Flood

dec page.



 1.   Insurance Agent to please add Named Storm/Hurricane coverage to insurance

    policy (Deductible not to exceed 10%.). (Note: If coverages are not

    reflected on the Evidence of Insurance, please provide endorsements page

    supporting appropriate coverage is issued.) 

 2.   Insurance Agent to add Loss of Rent coverage to the policy. (Note: If

    “Loss of Rent” is not specifically listed, please also provide the insurance

    company’s coverage explanation / description packet for review)

 3.   Insurance Agent to please confirm the premium balance due or if policy

    premium is paid in full.

 4.   Although Florida state law prohibits insurance agents from providing an

    actual replacement cost valuation we still need confirmation that the

    coverage amount covers 100% replacement cost of the subject property. In FL

    agents usually either confirm this via email for the analyst to upload or

    they provide this language on their policies allowing us to proceed.

 5.   Insurance Agent to confirm that Wind and Fire coverages are included with

    the policy.



Best,



Dan

confirms Dania Beach not Ft Lauderdale)



  o    Insurance Agent to confirm that Wind and Fire coverages are included with

Insurance to read - SHELLPOINT MORTGAGE SERVICING ISAOA ATIMA PO BOX 7050 TROY,

MI 48007-7050 (currently missing ISAOA ATIMA)



Insurance is the final item needed to wrap up underwriting.

Good afternoon, 







If you would like to be quoted with Citizens for a lower premium, we would need

both a Wind Mitigation and 4-Point inspection. Otherwise, we would need to quote

with our carrier who does not require an inspection, but their premiums may be

higher.
