RE: Loan no: 34991748
Title Insurance Underwriter must be licensed in the state of the property location. We require an ALTA
standard form title policy or equivalent state-promulgated coverage. Policy form version may be ALTA
2016 or 2021. ALTA Short Form or ALTA 2012 Short Form policies are also acceptable. (**ALTA
2006 policies are only acceptable in NY until the insurance commissioner approves a new form.) This is
a business purpose loan and is not subject to TRID Regulations. A Closing Disclosure (CD) is not
required but may be accepted in place of a HUD-1 Settlement Statement. Title policy must insure Kiavi
in 1st lien position. Kiavi will require the payoff of all liens, judgments, lis pendens, recorded
assessments or anything else that impairs our 1st lien position. Please note that Kiavi facilitates the
disbursement process of the construction holdback (if any) so we do not require coverage for FUTURE
mechanics liens for this policy (i.e. via endorsements or policy date-downs).
