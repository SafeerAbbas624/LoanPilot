Perfect — here's exactly what you need to build in Replit (or Vercel) to achieve your vision of a ChatGPT-powered Loan Processing Co-Pilot that:

✅ Integrates with OpenAI (ChatGPT API)

✅ Reads loan files

✅ Provides smart next-step guidance

✅ Writes emails to all parties

✅ Stores task progress and contact info per loan

🏗️ Core Architecture Overview
1. Frontend (React in Replit)
Loan intake form (lender, loan type, property, borrower name, purpose)

Chat interface (sends queries to GPT)

File viewer (lists Google Drive or uploaded docs)

Email generator section (GPT fills in drafts)

Status tracker (checklist, current step, last update)

2. Backend (Node/Express or Replit Server)
Handles Google OAuth & Drive API

Stores loan data + status in Supabase or SQLite

Sends requests to OpenAI API

Optionally sends emails using Resend or Nodemailer

🔌 Key Integrations
✅ OpenAI GPT (Core brain)
Input: Lender, loan type, uploaded file list

Output:

What docs are present / missing

What to do next

Who to reach out to (borrower, title, insurance, payoff lender)

Email drafts

✅ Google Drive API
Pulls file names from loan folder

Optionally reads PDF text (OCR + classification in GPT)

✅ Supabase (or Replit DB)
Store loan-level data:

Property info

Assigned VA

Loan stage

File checklist status

Contact info (borrower, title company, insurance agent)

📋 Example Use Flow (for a Loan Processor)
Logs in → Sees a new loan to work on

Selects lender (e.g. Roc Capital) + loan type (DSCR purchase)

Uploads or connects to Google Drive folder

App:

Scans file names

Sends info to GPT

GPT replies with:

✅ Docs received

❌ Missing items

📋 Action plan

✉️ Ready-to-send emails

📞 "Call title to confirm wiring" or "Follow up with insurance by Tuesday"

VA copies the emails or marks tasks complete

📦 What You Need to Build First (MVP)
Component	Function
🔐 Google OAuth	Auth for Drive access
📂 Drive folder picker	See files in the loan folder
📝 Loan intake form	Select lender, loan type, property info
🤖 GPT call	Prompt with lender + file list → returns actions/emails
📬 Email template viewer	Show GPT output, allow VA to copy/send
✅ Checklist manager	Mark what's done/missing
💾 Basic DB	Store each loan’s info and status

🧠 Prompt Logic Example (for GPT)
When the app sends a request to ChatGPT, it should include:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "lender": "Kiavi",
  "loan_type": "DSCR",
  "loan_purpose": "Purchase",
  "property_address": "321 NW 43rd St, Oakland Park, FL",
  "uploaded_files": [
    "DriverLicense.pdf",
    "BankStatement-Jan.pdf",
    "PurchaseContract.pdf"
  ],
  "borrower_name": "John Smith"
}
GPT returns:

What’s missing

What step is next

Who to contact

Email templates for:

Borrower (to request missing docs)

Title (for prelim or wiring)

Insurance (for updated binder)

Payoff lender (if refi)

✅ Your Next Move
If you're using Replit:

Start a new React + Node.js template

Add your Google API credentials and OpenAI key to .env

Use the Chat + File viewer layout

Hook GPT to your checklist logic
